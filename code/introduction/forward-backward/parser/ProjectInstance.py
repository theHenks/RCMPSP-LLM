        The available maximum capacity of the resource.
    renewable
        Whether the resource is renewable or not.
    skills
        Whether the resource has a skill or not. Default is ``None``,

    demands
        The resource demands (one per resource) of this processing mode.
    skill_requirements

class Activity:

    Parameters
    ----------
    modes
        The processing modes of this activity.
    successors

    predecessors
        The indices of predecessor activities.
    delays
        The delay for each successor activity. If delays are specified, then
        the length of this list must be equal to the length of `successors`.
        Delays are used for RCPSP/max instances, where the precedence
        relationship is defined as ``start(pred) + delay <= start(succ)``.
    optional
        Whether this activity is optional or not. Default ``False``.
    selection_groups
        The selection groups of this activity. If the current activity is
        scheduled, then for each group, exactly one activity must be scheduled.
        This is used for RCPSP-PS instances. Default is an empty list.
    name
        Optional name of the activity to identify this activity. This is
        helpful to map this activity back to the original problem instance.
